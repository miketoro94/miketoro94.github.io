<h2> <em> About Me </em></h2>
<p> I have always been into technology and building. I began to take an interest in gaming and technology when I was in middle school.</p>
<p>At first, I just spent hours and hours playing different games, becoming the best at it I might add. Of course, my parents were concerned at the amount of time I spent playing that my dad decided to show me beyond just playing games.</p>
<p>He showed me how it was that my computer worked and its different parts, he showed me how to build my own and make it the way I wanted it to be.</p>
<p>I learned the different parts that needed to be changed and fixed to make my PC its very best. This woke the curiosity in me, and it made me want to understand how websites worked and functioned, that’s when I began to learn about coding.</p>
<p>As a self-learner I learned many things but never enough, with the help of a program I entered I have been able to pursue this further and with these tools hope to someday get hired by an important company.</p>

<h2><em> Hobbies</em></h2>

During my free time I enjoy engaging in active hobbies such as soccer and not so active hobbies such as playing video games and watching movies. I have played soccer since I was very young.
My family would always get together every weekend and play, so I became better with time. I was even part of my family soccer team and it was a very competitive environment, so we played against other very good teams to win trophies and prizes.
Besides this most of my time is taken up by videogames. I love to play action, sport, fighting, and shooting games. I started getting into online gaming when I was in middle school.
I believe I’m a really good gamer and I currently play online with some friends and form teams. When I’m not doing any of these things, I usually spend time with my family going out bowling, playing pool, to the movies.
